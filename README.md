# Wifi Password Receiver
This is a simple Python script that uses subprocess and colorama. It will output a list of Wifi names and their password after it. If there is no password, it will show in yellow text, "No Password". `Note: It will only show you the passwords to wifi's you've ALREADY connected to.` Here's an example:
```
Home Wifi     | password123
Joe's House   | ILOVEFORTNITE
Bob's House   | verysecurepassword
```
